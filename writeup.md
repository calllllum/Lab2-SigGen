## Task 1
 All tasks completed normally.

 Test yourself challenge involved changing the value of incr to vbdValue(). Increasing vbdValue() meant that we skipped values retrieved from the ROM, plotting the sine wave at a higher frequency. We do skip values however, meaning that the shape of the sine wave is blocky. The only way to fix this is to make clock frequency faster.
